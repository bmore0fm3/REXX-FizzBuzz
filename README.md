# FizzBuzz
 Learning ooREXX and practicing Test Driven Development with ooRexUnit. 
 Used example from ooRexxUnit: A jUnit Compliant Testing Framework for ooREXX programs by Rony G. Flatscher
    Instead of using ~run I use ~execute

 Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of thre print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz". 

Using TDD idea of Red -> Green -> Refactor
